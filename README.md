## :scroll: Description
This repository is for the fourth week of the [#AndroidDevChallenge](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/android-dev-challenge-4.html).


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Create a single-screen weather forecast app. You have until March 23rd, 23:59 PST to submit your entry.

Your UI must be fully built in Compose. You can use fake weather data.

We will judge your submission on these four categories:

1. Visual beauty
1. Novelty of idea
1. Code quality
1. Overall execution (including accessibility)
